/**
 * The {@code EntityState} interface represents the state of an entity within the system.
 * It serves as a base interface for defining state-related properties and behaviors
 * for entities such as agents, objects, or other components in the environment.
 *
 * <p>This interface is designed to be extended or implemented by classes that need to
 * represent and manage the dynamic state of entities, such as their activity, health,
 * or other attributes.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *     public class MyEntityState implements EntityState {
 *         private String status;
 *         // Implement methods to manage entity state
 *     }
 * </pre>
